As such, the full scope of robotics lies at the intersection of mechanics, electronics, signal processing, control engineering, computing, and mathematical modeling. Within this very broad framework, modeling and control play a basic role - not only in the traditional context of industrial robotics, but also for the advanced applications of field and service robots, which have attracted increasing interest from the research community in the last twenty years.",
